2.  Find the change you want to plan the activity, click on "Open"
    and then on "Reversion plan”;

    !!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
        When linking an existing Kanban, if the user does not have permission to access 
        a particular Workspace, the system will display a message informing it. The user 
        must then request permission in Workspace and Sprint or create a new Kanban framework.

5.  It's also possible to link incidents, problems, lessons learned (which are
    knowledge about the change made) and files attachments to detail the change
    execution. To do so, it's necessary to click on the tab available, select the
    item you want to link it to the change.

6.  Click on the tab "More" and then on "Closure" to register the data about
    the change execution, for example: solution category, status of change, and others.
    In the same tab, in the "Notes" option, it's available a field to point information
    relevant to this phase of the flow.

7.  Click on "Options" and the on "Save and keep current task" to register the

!!! Abstract "Problem Registration"    

    In the closure of a change, the tool has functionality that verifies the existence of 
    related problems and, if they exist, automatically closes them. The functionality is in 
    the default system flow for the change management process.
