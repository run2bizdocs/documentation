It is known that working with real-time information in decision making makes
companies more competitive and qualified to meet their demands and their

managers better understand their business activities and how to employ the

### Our vision for the future

Agile is the new normal. Adapting quickly is almost obligatory.

CITSmart is designed to move departments and people in an agile concept,
without forgetting the human factor, towards the goals established by each
organization. We believe that more than speed, the important thing is to have
consistency in movement.

The future vision of CITSmart is based on 4 pillars: **People, Processes,
Experiences and Results.**

| **Pillar**      | Our view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **People**      | It's the source of everything. It's the motivation for everything. However, it may also be the fault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Processes**   | It's the way to guide people's experiences (work experiences and experiences for clients). It's the way to move people towards the right direction.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Experiences** | Experiences move people. They release good feelings. It's transformative. It's motivating. It's loyalty. It's future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Results**     | That's what everyone is after. Represents delivering value to someone. At the end of every cycle, everything that involves the previous pillars must converge to results for the department and the organization. Here are the goals and challenges to be achieved. This pillar guides all of the previous ones on the way to pursue. |


Processes link people to one another. Have processes from the perspective of
generating positive experiences and people will be more connected, produce more,
and deliver more, that is, they will achieve the desired results. Experiences in
the work and experiences for clients. The tips connect. Positive experiences
represent the source of trust. And trust is the foundation of everything.

Experiences represent the new motivation of the new generation, be it for work
or purchase. Prepare for this future.
