Title: Cloud Architecture

# 4biz Cloud Architecture

Focused on a global expansion, and a technological infrastructure that meets the requirements of our customers and partners, 4biz opted for the SaaS (Software As a Service) model to ensure agility in delivering solutions to our customers and partners, and provide a resilient, reliable and secure infrastructure. In the cloud we have a computational infrastructure and a network architecture designed to meet the highest technological and security requirements of the world market.

Following the example of large companies offering their services based on cloud-based solutions, 4biz uses the technology and security features provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using the AWS cloud, we, our partners and customers can enjoy:

* A highly scalable computing platform with high reliability and availability and physical security designed for large scales.

* A legacy of managing various compliance programs and certifications. This means that we automatically inherit compliance with various infrastructure requirements and standards.

In addition to the capabilities provided by the cloud, 4biz seeks to maintain the security and privacy of its customers' data through internal policies and adoption of standards to ensure compliance with international regulatory requirements.
