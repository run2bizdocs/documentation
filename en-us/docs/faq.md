## Processes

### Ticket Management

***Usage***

!!! Question "Is it possible to categorize the Request/Incident (Ticket)?"    

    Both Request and Incident can be categorized in the doc [registering of activities in a service](https://documentation.run2biz.com/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-service-activity.html). The categories can be created on the same registration screen, at the time of category linking, or on specific features for [Create service category](https://documentation.run2biz.com/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/configuration/create-service-category.html).   

!!! Question "Is it possible to attach documents to incidents, requests, problems and changes?"

    Both Request and Incident may have documents attatched in their opening and attendance. For Problems and Changes, documents may be attached to each phase of the solution and also, if necessary, in each of the stages defined in the solution of the problem or change.
    Documents can be of any type (extension) and their maximum size can be set by the manager in system parameter 278 (default is 1GB).
     
!!! Question "How to access the service request from the email notification?"

    To access the service request from the email notification, follow the guidelines below:
    
    1. Make sure you are logged in the system;
    2. Open the email notification of the service request;
    3. The notification will have the request number with a hyperlink, just click on the number, which will be redirected to the Service Management screen, presenting the request information.

!!! Question "What is the impact of the "Solver Group" filter on the behavior of requests and incidents searches?"
    
    When the "solver group" filter is active, only closed ones will be presented, since when selecting this filter, it is understood that there is a need to present the group that actually solved a request, not presenting groups responsible for tasks (according to The flow bound to the service request) executed after the request is solved.
    
	Let's look at a generic example:
	
    - For example, service A has a linked quality flow, after solving a service request and advancing the flow, the responsible group will be the quality group and this will finish the lifecycle of the request in question, but this group is not The group that solved this request, it only approved the solution and finished the request, so it will not appear in the report generated by the Inquiries and Incidents search screen when the "Solver Group" filter is marked with a specific group.
    
    - However, when the "Solver Group" filter is not active, the group presented in the report or search will be the group referring to the current request task, that is, if the request is closed and has a quality flow, the group will be presented with quality as the current group responsible for closing the lifecycle of this request. If the request is in progress, it will be presented the current group responsible for the execution of this request.

!!! Question "Why the service request numbering not always follow a strict/perfect sequential order on the service request screen or in some reports?"
    
    Both the Service Request screen and some reports (such as "Quality of Service - SLA"), the order follows an increasing sequential, except when:
    
    1- The reports group the data by some special criteria (eg, by SLA, which is what happens in the report "Quality of Service - SLA");
    2- When the feature called Sequence Block is impacted by an external factor, this occurs if:
    
        -  There is an application stop for version upgrade, or environment maintenance and later return;
    
        -  The environment is clustered.

***Configuration***    

!!! Question "How to configure the service request notification emails?"
    
    When registering a service request, perform determined activities and its execution, the requester will be notified.
    
    In order for the notification be sent, it is necessary to perform the following procedures:
    
    1- Access the Contract Services related to the business service Portfolio Management > Services Portfolio > Business Service > Contract > Services and technical service Portfolio Management > Service Portfolio > Business Service > Support/Technical Service > Contract > Services and enter the email template in the fields:
    
       -   'Incident/Request Opening Email Template'
	
       -   'Incident/Request Execution Email Template'
	
       -   'Incident/Request Ongoing Activities Email Template'
        
      RULE: If the email templates are not entered, the notification will not be sent.

    2- Access the Group Registration through the main menu feature General Registration > Staff Management > Group;
    
    3- The Group Registration screen will be displayed. If the group has already been registered in the system, search for it;
    
    4- Select it;
    
    5- It will be displayed the group screen. Determine if the email notifications (opening, in progress and execution) related to the requests will be mandatory;
    
    RULE: if it is determined that notifications will be mandatory, when registering a service request, on the Incident/Request Service entry screen, these options will be already selected, not allowing any changes. But if it has been determined that notifications will not be mandatory, when registering a service request, these options will be available to be determined by the requester.
    
    6- On the Incident/Request screen, when registering a service request, the rules related to the email notifications will be established, determined in the group entry.
    
    RULE: when registering a service request, the notification will only be sent to the performer group, which is responsible for 
    attending the request. When the activities are in progress and then finished, the notifications will only be sent to the 
    requester.

    RULE: after setting the parameter, when registering a Service Request/Incident, if you have not informed the group, the group will be scaled, which was defined in the parameter For 1st level service.    
    
    
!!! Question "Why does the system display an invalid date message when auditing the ticket?"

    In the Ticket Management interface, specifically in the "Audit" item, when trying to configure the auditing of an open ticket (set start and end dates in the filter), the following error may occur: "Invalid Date". This is because the functionality requires that the language set in the system and browser used are the same.
    If this requirement is not observed and this difference occurs in the languages, when auditing the tickets, the system will display a message and make it impossible to obtain the desired report. It's therefore necessary to match the system and browser languages.

### Knowledge Management

***Usage***

!!! Question "What is the meaning of each privacy a knowledge can have in the knowledge base?"
    
    - Public: all users with access to the Knowledge Portal have access, regardless of whether they have access to the knowledge folder.
    - Confidential: only author and approver can view knowledge.
    - Internal: only people with permission in the knowledge folder can view.
    
!!! Question "Is it possible to version knowledge in the knowledge management?"
    
    To version a knowledge, open one in the knowledge management interface, click on "Edit" in the knowledge information screen and then on "Version". It's also possible to "Archive the previous version" of the knowledge.    

***Configuration***

!!! Question "How are documents ranked at the time of SOLR knowledge base search?"
    
    To rank the documents at the time of the search, Solr generates a score for each document.
    
    Thus, the document that has the highest score, is presented first and the others, with lower scores, in sequence.
    
    To calculate the document score Solr uses a standard algorithm, where the frequency of the searched term is checked. But, it is possible to change the punctuation with the use of the boosts.
    
    Solr's boosters can be used in two moments at the time of indexing or query, and their use in search is more common.
    Some boosters that may change the calculation of the score at the time of the survey are:
    
    -   term^num: where "num" is the importance of the search term, example: incident^2;
    
    -   And the field boosters and dismax and edismax functions can also be used to boost search.
    
    At ITSM, no booster is used, so far, only Solr's standard score calculation is used, and at the end of the search the ranking is done by the score and by the number of times the knowledge was voted / liked.
    
    Boosters are open for use, but to use them requires a better analysis of the importance of fields and documents added to Solr, by the knowledge base.
    
!!! Question "How to setup the SOLR feature?"
    
    PARAMETER CONFIGURATION
    
    1. To configure a parameter navigate to the screen “Parametrization > Knowledge Management”;
    2. Search for the parameter “SOLR URL server (i.e.: http://localhost:8983/solr/collection_name)”;
    3. After inserting the SOLR server URL, a URL example would be the following: http://localhost:8983/solr/base_conhecimento .

    INDEXING EXISTING KNOWLEDGE ENTRIES
	
    1. To index knowledge entries navigate to the screen “System > Configurations > Knowledge Management (Index)”;
    2. If there are indexed knowledge entries already click on “Remove Knowledge base index”;
    3. Shortly after, click on "Index Knowledge Base";
    4. If any errors occur click on “Refresh the Index Server”;
    5. Shortly after, click again on ”Index Knowledge Base";
    6. If any errors occur contact the ITSM Support.

### Event Management

***Usage***

!!! Question "How can Event Management become a business monitoring tool?"

    WEBSERVICE SCHEME FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS (BUSINESS MONITORING)
    It is possible to connect the EVM component to any software, even one other than the one that the Event Management module normally integrates (Nagios, Zabbix and Inventory), since the data sent (via webservice) follow a pre-established pattern.
    
    Once the data is sent to the 4biz Event Monitor, rules can be created (for example with the Esper EPL) so that certain events are triggered according to some condition observed in the data.
    
    Example "Payroll">
    
    -   Let's say that the rule is that one company does not hire more than 5 employees per sector;
    -   The payroll program could send the minimum data of each hiring by department (defined in the company's budget plan), so that whenever the contraction number per department exceeds the pre-established limit, an event of "excess hiring" could be triggered.

!!! Question "What permissions are necessary on the destination folder of the Logdata table backup?"

    The permissions on the folder must be read and write to the user that JBoss uses.
    
!!! Question "When does data synchronization occur with LDAP?"
    
    The system synchronizes the credential data of its users with LDAP in three different situations:
    
    1. On application activation, usually in sequence to the product version update procedure;
    2. When the user logs in (access to the system with its login and password), then the system automatically checks the user's 
    authentication and permission;
    3. In the LDAP Configuration menu option, when the user clicks its 'Synchronize' link.   

!!! Question "When is removed the data from the Logdata table?"
    
    The backup routine of the LogData table removes the data from the table and saves it to a file, that is, the table becomes clean after processing.
    
!!! Question "Why are the schedules created by the tool different from the current time?"
    
    SCENARIO
    
    1. When creating a ticket, the time is different from the actual time, alternating between 1 (one) and 3 (three) hours of delay or advance.

    WHAT TO CHECK
    
    1. Postgresql database configuration file:
    
        Postgresql.conf - timezone = 'BRAZIL/EAST'
    
    2. On the container cloud:
    
        Setting timezone on the operating system.
    
    3. Setting up the TimeZone on the JRE:
    
        https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/troubleshoot/time-zone-settings-jre.htm#JSTGD362    

!!! Question "Why in some reports does the same request appear more than once?"
    
    In some reports such as "Report Incidents / Service Requests - Detailed", both in pdf format and in xls format, the same request may exist more than once, however they are distinct details because it deals with each step of the request, so each time it "repeats" is because it changes the task, or the responsible, or the phase, or the situation, or the group solver or the final hour of service.
    
    In other reports, such as the "Report Incidents / Service Requests", there is no detail of the request according to the activities and therefore the request is not shown more than once.
    
!!! Question "Why is the result 'Empty Report' when generating the reportQuantitativeControlPercentual when selecting in the filter the situation 'in progress' and the 'solver group'?"
    
    This is not an error, the solver group field is populated only when the request is terminated, this causes to only brings results to situations such as "Closed", incompatible with what is being requested / reported in the filters.    

!!! Question "Will the backup be overwritten or will there be a file for every day?"
    
    If your routine has a daily backup, a file will be created every day, containing the name and date of the file.
    
!!! Question "Why does my instance with DBMS SQL Server is slow on the ticket listing screen?" 

    In the standalone.xml file you must add the following configuration to the SQL Server database access URL:
    ;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=false
    
    - Example:

    ```java
    jdbc:sqlserver://server:port;databaseName=myDataBase;sendStringParametersAsUnicode=false
    ```

    Enter the configuration of all dataSources.

!!! Question "How can the expiration time of the application sessions be changed?"
    
    This type of change is configured in the functionality Parametrization > 4biz Parameters. Then, select the parameter 449 and add the value you want in minutes. After that, you need to disconnect and reconnect to the system, so the system will look for the new default for session expiration time.
