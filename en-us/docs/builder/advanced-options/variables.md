    - Name of the variable;  
    - Description;  
    - Whether it will be stored in the database;

    - Whether it is a return variable;  
	    - This option will cause **Neuro** to return the variable at the end of the flow run.  
    - Whether it is a list of values;  
    - If it is an input variable in the flow interface;  
	    - This option allows the variable to be "injected" into the business process linked to this flow.  
    - If it is an output variable in the flow interface;  
	    - This option causes the variable to have the value filled when the business process bound to the flow is executed.  
    - The type of the variable;  
	    - If it is a Java object, enter the corresponding Java class;  
	    - If it is a business object, what its respective application is and what the registered name of the business object;  
    - The initial value of the variable, whether constant or script.  
	    - If the value is a constant, it will never be changed during the execution of the flow, regardless of the operations    performed by the user.
