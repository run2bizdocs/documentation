Description: This document is intended to configure the activity within the tasker, called user task. 

# Configure user activity in the tasker

When designing a workflow, it is possible to insert several elements, among
them, the User Activity. This document is intended to guide the configuration of
this element in the workflow.

Before getting started
----------------------

To use the "User Activity" element, it's necessary to have, at least, a
registered workflow in the tool, with the event elements: "start" and "end".

Procedure
---------

1.  Access the main menu Tracker \> Flow Design;

2.  Click on "New”;

3.  Click on the Diagram tab and then on Activity;

4.  Click on the User Task element and drag it to the workflow creation panel;

5.  The following element configuration tabs will be opened:

**Identification**

-   Name: name of the user task;

-   Description: detail the user task;

-   Type of instance:

    -   A single instance: it can only have a single non-executed instance of
        the task in the workflow;

    -   More than one instance controlled by the workflow: it can have multiple
        instances not executed from the task;

    -   Create an instance for each user: in the assignment, if there is a
        semicolon in the users, a task will be created for each user;

-   Identifier: it is a unique acronym for the task and it is used to code Rhino
    and for Builder forms;

-   Counts SLA: it sets "Yes" or "No" ( the "Suspend SLA" status will appear in
    the ticket management interface);

-   Execution percentage: informative field about the percentage of this task in
    the entire workflow;

-   Is it an approval task?: set "Yes" or "No”;

**Assignment**

-   Recipient type: select whether it will be for a specific group or user

-   Assignment Type: define whether the assignment will be execution or
    monitoring

-   Group/User: select the group/user

-   Or Expression: search for an expression already registered

**User actions**

-   Select the registration action: it searches for the action already
    registered (e.g.:, approval action, that is, an expression for this
    purpose);

**Input action**

-   Build expression: it directly defines an expression

-   Select registration action: it searches for an action already registered

**Output action**

-   Build expression: it directly defines an expression

-   Select registration action: it searches for an action already registered

**Interface**

-   Interaction type: it is the way in which a Questionnaire or a Builder Form
    will be applied in the ticket management interface, in a given workflow
    status. The configuration of items that will be visible can be defined in
    the portfolio, or configured directly in the User Activity element (of the
    workflow):

    -   Defined in portfolio: it is possible for a ticket template
        (questionnaire or form) to appear punctually in a workflow status, using
        what has been configured in the service attribute "Activity"
        (request/incident) - fields: “CREATION Template” and “Monitoring
        Template”. This option is advantageous when you have generic workflows
        used by several services.

    -   Standard form: default from system

    -   Builder Form: it has an identifier to call for the workflow triggered by
        this form

-   Template (Standard/Builder): it allows to link the ticket template.

-   !!! Abstract "ATTENTION"

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If there is no linking of a service request template in the interface tab, the system will subtend 
    and apply the settings of a standard form, enabling configuration item, change, problem and request 
    related to the ticket.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Allows to direct to group: enables the activation/deactivation of the
    "Direct to group" option in the registration of a ticket;

-   Allows to change the status: it makes visible/invisible the ticket
    attendance options (Registered/In Progress; Solved and Canceled);

-   Enables email notification: it makes the email notification options
    visible/invisible;

-   Allows delegate attendance: it enables the activation/deactivation of the
    "Delegate" option, in order to be visible in the options menu of the ticket
    management;

-   Allows change screen data: allows to edit questionnaires on the ticket
    management screen.

!!! Abstract "RULE"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rules configured in the workflow will have priority over the service request template markings, as this is a 
complement to the workflow.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Knowledge Base**

-   Link knowledge base: choose the knowledge you want to link to the user task.

!!! Abstract "ATTENTION"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main purpose of linking this knowledge is to allow the attendant of a request/incident to have easy access to it. 
As soon as the workflow arrives at the activity of the flow linked to a knowledge, the button "Knowledge" is shown in 
the upper right corner of the Request/Incident screen, to give read access to the content, for that, such knowledge is 
usually written in the form of a step by step.
