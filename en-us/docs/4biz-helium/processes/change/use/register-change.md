title: Create Change
Description: It's intended to register a change.

# Create Change

This functionality is intended to create a new change. According to ITIL, it's necessary to formalize the change request, so that the responsible team registers all the procedures performed for the requested change (from its request to the impact of its implementation), and monitors it throughout its lifecycle.


Before getting started
------------------

Here are the pre requirements to create a change: create a contract, a unit that it is linked to the contract, an employee, a questionnaire, the Change Advisory Board, create a group linked to the contract associated with the Requesters (employees). 
Moreover, the portfolio for that change must have already been created.

Procedure
--------------
1.    Access the main menu Processes > Change Management > Change;
2.    Click on "Options" and then on "Register";
3.    Complete the fields available:

### Agile analysis of risk

In the risk analysis area, three questions will be asked:

* Is there a risk stopping important services? - with the options "Yes" or "No"

* Is there a risk of financial loss? - with the options "Yes" or "No"

* Is there an image risk? - with the options "Yes" or "No"

then a representation of the risk from 0 to 100 will be presented.

### Planning

To plan the change use the features:
