# Overview  

Presentation
----------------

Change Management is the process responsible to evaluate, coordinate and decide about making change proposals to Configuration Items (CI). According

to ITIL, the main goal of this process is to ensure that changes are made in a controlled way, and being evaluated, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, and documented.

Changes can be categorized as: Standard Change, Normal Change and Emergency Change.


-   **Standard Change**:preauthorized,  low risk change. Usually the most frequent type of change. It is initiated by a defined trigger that follows a procedure or work instruction to make the activities that are well known and have a pre-determined budget. E.g.: Install a standard desktop application package.

-   **Normal Change**: any change in services other than emergency or standard. It follows the policies, deadlines and procedures defined by the organization.

-   **Emergency Change**: changes that need to be done as soon as possible. E.g.: Change to resolve a Major Incident or implement a security fix.
