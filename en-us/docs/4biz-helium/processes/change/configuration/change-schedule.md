# Calendar of changes

This functionality is intended to manage the periods in which the organization will go through a period of maintenance or blackout, thus, helping in the change planning.

Procedure
------------

1.  Access the main menu Processes > Change Management > Window of Change.

2.  In the Change calendar you can see the periods of maintenance and blackout.

3.  To register a new change window, click on the date you want.

4.  Complete the necessary fields (title, type, start and end date/time, description of change, recurrence of window of change). There are two types of change window:

    -   Maintenance: used to establish periods of time that changes in the CI will occur.

    -   Blackout: used to establish periods of time that changes in the CI cannot occur.

5.  Remember that the "Global" field should only be selected for "Maintenance" type of window of change, since this field should only be used for a maintenance window that does not have associated CI.

6.  Click on "Add".
