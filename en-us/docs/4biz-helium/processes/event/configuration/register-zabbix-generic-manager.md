# Register Zabbix generic manager

The purpose of this functionality is to register and maintain the generic
managers, who will be responsible for monitoring the hosts and/or triggers of
the Zabbix monitoring tool.

The managers allow the monitoring of all hosts or all triggers in a generic way,
that is, without the obligation to choose a specific host for monitoring.

The purpose is to simplify the monitoring of an entire network in search of the
relevant events for the business.

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and
deleting a Zabbix generic manager.
