title: Register Global manager
Description: 
# Register Global manager

This functionality is intended to create rules to monitor several types of
events.

Each global event manager contains an EPL for *Information*, *Warning*, and/or
*Exception*. EPL is an event correlation language used by Esper (Espertech). In
the initialization of 4biz Event Monitor, these EPLs are imported into the
Esper engine so that a new correlated event will be created each time the
condition set in the EPL is satisfied. 

Events and alerts related to 

- Business Processes, Service Level Requirements 

- Awareness of similar and multiple events per CI or Service, 

- Connection to Incident prioritisation codes and categorizations,

- Control action, 

- Access to information on supporting and dependent CIs, the Change schedule, and known error information from vendors

Example of an EPL that correlates between
4biz Inventory and Nagios events: \@Description ('For any Nagios event that
occurs after any Inventory event in the last 10 minutes) select \* from pattern
[every a = EventCheckInventory- \> b = EventServiceNagios where timer: within
(10minutes)].

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and
deleting a global manager.

Before getting started
--------------------------

To register the Global manager, it's necessary to previously register the
4biz Event Monitor connection, time, occurrence category, automatic action
and the 4biz Inventory connection.

    \> Global Events Manager;

         - Select the action that will be triggered when there is an event of type
           *information*, the degree of urgency and impact. The rules for this action

       - Enter the data of **Action to Warning**:

         - Select the action that will be triggered when there is an event of type

           occurrence of type *exception*, the degree of urgency and impact. The
           rules for this action are defined using the Event Processing Language
           (EPL). Click the *Validate EPL of Exception* button to validate the EPL
           entered.
