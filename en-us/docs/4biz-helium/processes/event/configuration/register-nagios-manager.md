# Register Nagios manager

Nagios is a network monitoring tool. It can monitor both hosts and services,
warning when happening the problems and also when the problems are solved. The
Hosts are equipment and Services are resources offered by the equipment.

The objective of this functionality is to register and maintain the managers that
will be responsible for monitor the configuration items and event occurrences
captured from Nagios. It allows the user to inform when the Manager will be
processed, which configuration items will manage and the actions to be taken
automatically.

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and
deleting a Nagios manager.
