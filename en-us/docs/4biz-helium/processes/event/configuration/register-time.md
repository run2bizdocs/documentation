# Register time

This functionality is intended to shcedule tasks. It will choose the filters of
date and time, and will be created a Creon Expression for creating triggers
scheduled to be periodically used in the time and date established. For example,
to make an inventory in the network, it's necessary to previously select a
schedule, so the system will execute this inventory as the time chosen.

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and
deleting a time.
