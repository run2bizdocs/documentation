title: Creating knowledge
Description: It's possible to create, edit and search knowledge about several subjects, ranging from clarifying a functionality to more technical guidelines.

# Creating knowledge

Creating knowledge is the act of saving information at 4biz using the Knowledge Management functionality. At this point you'll interact with the interface and its applications. Note that to perform any action it's necessary to have appropriate permissions, therefore, your view is limited to the type of profile created.

## Before getting started

- [X] it's necessary to create folders and define access permissions. With this you can organize the knowledge and allow an easy location when performing a search. (see [Creating access profile][2])  
- [X] To use the notification features, it's necessary to configure the parameters: **82** and **83** (Knowledge Creation/Change), **84** (Deleting knowledge) and **78** and **456** (Expiration of knowledge). (see [Configuring email template][3], see [Configuring parametrization - knowledge][4]).


!!! note "NOTE"
    
    Parameters 82 and 83 have the same function, so it's not necessary to configure these two parameters, choose one of them. This is because now it has been gathered in a key email template that contemplates all activities that go from creating to archiving knowledge.     And what does it mean? In this new scenario you'll use an email template that will contain several keys.    
    This template is already available in a clean installation, or if you already have an environment and are going to update it, you can use the email keys in your already used templates so that they stay in the new standard (see [Key fields of knowledge base emails][5], see [Examples of email templates][6]).

## Procedure
1. Access the functionality through the menu Processes > Knowledge Management > Knowledge Management;

### Search and Filters
When accessing the Knowledge Management, you'll see the main knowledge management interface.  
In it you'll find all the knowledge base registries, being able to perform several actions (depending on your permissions in the system), creating new knowledge or editing an existing one.  
To locate a knowledge base, you have the following filters:

|  Field | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Title | Enter a term that refers to the name of the knowledge. |
| Document type | Select the type of information registered. By default, we have several options to select: ***Document, FAQ, Known Error, Test Evidence, Recovery measure, Emergency Response Plan, Damage Evaluation Plan, Rescue Plan, Vitar Records Plan, Crisis Management and Public Relationships Plan, Accommodation and Services Plan, Communication Plan, Finances and Administration Plan, Service Quality Plan, Availability Plan, News.***|
| Content | Enter a brief part of the knowledge, you can enter a word or a short sentence. |
| View by | Select a criterion that references the actions you're allowed. By default, we have the options: ***All, Can Review, Can Approve, Can Publish***|
| Situation | Select a criterion that matches the knowledge status. By default, we have the options: ***All, In drawing, In revision, Reviewed, In Publication, Published, Archived*** |
| Folder | Select the folder where the knowledge was created. By default, we have the options: ***Service Desk, FAQ, For Approval, Partner Portal***|

!!! TIP "TIP"

    **For the Selection fields** - Other Itens can be created as the business needed.

!!! note "NOTE"
    
    If the option for known error is selected in the document type field, the system will present a field to define which environment this knowledge should be linked to (Production or development)
    
!!! note "NOTE"

    Set the field "Origin" to indicate from where you're creating the knowledge, that can be used to be linked in another process. 

#### Knowledge Content

You have an editor [WYSIWYG][1] to work with the HTML content of your document. In it you can insert and edit the text, and you can also insert images, videos, hyperlinks and others.

- To add a link (hyperlink) to the knowledge content, in order to access an external link, select a word or phrase and click on the “Insert/Edit link” button (the chain icon), complete the fields and click on “OK”;

- To add an image to the knowledge content, click on the “Image” button (the landscape icon) or copy and paste the image saved to a file on your computer;

- To add a video, click on the “Insert a video” button:
    - In the *Server video* tab: it allows to insert a video that is located on the video server or on the computer;
    - In the *Embedded* tab: it allows to insert YouTube videos. When accessing the video, right-click and select “Copy embed code”.

### Saving

When creating a knowledge, 4biz will always establish version "1.0" and, when changing a document, the operator can indicate whether the change should be Versioned or not and also if previous versions must be archived.

!!! abstract "NOTE"

    The tool will inform in a pop-up, if there's a same article you're creating exists in the Knowledge Base.

### Tips

!!! warning "ATTENTION"
    
    Pay attention when using “Public” privacy, as there is a risk of making documents inappropriately available. This scenario disregards the access profile configuration and releases document access for all users.

!!! note "Approval Tracker"
    
    The end user can propose new Documents/Knowledge on the floating button of the Knowledge Portal, the Document is saved in the folder indicated by Parameter 313 of the system. The knowledge Manager searches for unpublished documents or in the indicated folder and, as the approval progresses, the document will gain other statuses.
