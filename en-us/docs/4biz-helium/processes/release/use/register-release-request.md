    Major release means a new version of Software that includes changes to the architecture and/or adds new features and functionality in addition to the original functional characteristics of the preceding software release.

    Significant release adds features and functionality improving overall product performance, efficiency, and usability.

## Creating Kanban to the Planning and Deployment phases

In the tool, the Planning and Deployment phases use Workspaces based on Kanban methodology to the easy and agile management of activities, visually organizing in a framework with cards that indicate flow progress.

This space is to detail the rollout plan, rollback, service validation, test, and activities. In the Workspace, activities are inserted and grouped by projects (Workspace), task pane (Sprint) and finally tasks, which can be in groups of cards.

Moreover, you can create a Workspace for the planning or deployment phase you want, for example, for a rollout plan, you can create a workspace called "Rollout Plan" and populate with the information necessary to accomplish that, including the phases, group responsible, notes and history.

For a better understanding of how to create a workspace, or using the planning and deployment phases, see the documents:


- [Tasker Agile Management](https://documentation.run2biz.com/en-us/4biz-helium/additional-features/project-management/tasker-agile-management/simple-agile-management.html). Tasker is the functionality of the tool that creates the kanbans.

## Editing release

Once created a release, it's possible to edit all the information we found in its registration. In addition to that, it'll appear the "Closure" phase, at the end of the page, where you can change the status of the release.

In the Closure field, at the end of the page, there's the following situation:

| Situation        | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **In Execution** | To edit and see the release without finishing it |
| **Solved**       | To solve and finish the release                  |
| **Canceled**     | To cancel the release                            |

To see how to finish the release, see the document [Executing Release](https://documentation.run2biz.com/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/release/use/execute-release.html)
