title: Invoke continuity

Description: This functionality invokes the service continuity.
# Invoke continuity

The Continuity Registration is a process that pass through several phases. The fourth phase is the Continuous Operation, where it'll be defined the continuity Awareness (education and training), Review and continuity audit, the continuity tests and its Invocation. This functionality invokes the service continuity.
The trigger to have an invocation is the opening of an incident of critical type. The incident have to be approved to be presented in the Invocation screen.

Before getting started
--------------------------

It assumes the existence of a defined service in a Portfolio and Catalog
Management process.

The tool integrate with Service Level Management trough the Service Catalog and Portfolio Management to track business process / service criticality, time period criticality (e.g. time of day / week / month / year when disruption would be most severe), and service level recovery targets. This information can be configurated in CMDB&Asset Management in attributes of CI.

It's fundamental to firstly have registered the Continuity Registration, the
policy and the project of service continuity already defined, in addition to
having the scope, vital functions, business impact analysis, risk evaluation,
strategy, plan , organizational planning, the strategy of tests of continuity
awareness already registered and the audit and review of the continuity already
performed. It is even recommended to check the continuity testing calendar.

It's necessary to have registered the threat and threat category both linked to
each other. It is also essential to have registered the risk and risk category.

It's equally essential to have previously registered the automatic actions of
incident, request and procedure about the Event Management.
