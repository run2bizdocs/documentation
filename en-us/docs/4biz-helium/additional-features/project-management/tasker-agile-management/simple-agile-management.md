Title: Tasker Agile Management

# Tasker Agile Management


4biz Tasker is a functionality of the 4biz that allows the easy and agile
management of activities. It was created to manage projects in the simplest way,
with resources to organize, monitor and delegate the activities among the members
of your team or individually.

Tasker is based on the Kanban methodology, it's visually organized in a framework
with cards that indicate the flow progress.

In the Tasker workspace, activities are inserted and grouped by projects
(in Tasker called Workspace), task pane (in Tasker called Sprint) and finally
tasks, which can be in groups of cards.

    Figure 1 - Workspace Screen

    -   **1**: searches for any information that is in any other Workspace, Sprint, 
        List or Task. It is possible the search that selects the activities by the estimated 
        date of its development (the period of beginning and conclusion). To use this search 
        feature, follow the instructions bellow:
   
        -   For the correct operation of this field, it is necessary that the Workspace, 
            Sprint and activity have an estimated date of beginning and end; 
       
        -   Make the search. The system will then return a list of Workspaces, Sprints and 
            Lists that are between the date referenced in the search.

     -   **2**: create new Sprint

     -   **3**: abbreviation of added member names. By clicking on it, it's possible to
         delete and define if the member will be manager or not

     -   **4**: add member that will participate in the Sprint

     -   **5**: actions for configuring the Workspace and access to *Profiles and permissions*:
   
         -   The Permissions in Workspace and Sprint, when the **Administrator** is logged, will 
             be selected by default and cannot be changed. Only when the user is of type **Normal** 
             will the permissions be editable. The Workspace Administrator can change the project 
             manager (Administrator permission) on each Sprint. If the user is not the Workspace 
             Administrator, you cannot give the administrator permission to another user.
           
         -   With the profile of type **Normal** within the Workspace or Sprint, if the user ticks 
             the checkbox **Change the permissions of Workspace/Sprint members**, the permission of 
             the other members of the project to which they belong will be released, or whether a user 
             who **does not** have the Administrator profile, can change the permission status of each 
             member, even if he/she is not the Administrator.     

3.  Each Workspace will have in its home screen a summary of Sprints and
    its deadlines:

    -   Expired: it presents the number of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    smaller than the current date/time;

    -   To be expired: it presents the numer of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    that will expire in 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   On time: it presents the number of **Sprints** with the "delivery date"
    bigger than 24hs from the current date/time;

    -   Total: sum of the **Sprints** inside the Workspace.
