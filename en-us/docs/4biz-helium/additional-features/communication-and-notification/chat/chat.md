Title: Chat
# Chat

The notion of "Chat" is used to allude to the exchange of written messages of instantaneous form. In this case, it allows the user to have the right contact to the system attendant in order to solve doubts, make requests and others. The parameters of this application allow to activate the chat, set the default agreement for call opening and adjust the default group, and other actions.

Chat can be used in three ways:

-   Manual: exchange of messages between several types of users (e.g.: requester
    and attendant) on a CITSmart instance;

-   Automatic: used for messaging between user and a virtual assistant - via Chatbot, 
    using Anuva artificial intelligence;

-   Both: used to enable contact between the requester and the attendant, also allowing 
    a user to interact with a chatbot.
