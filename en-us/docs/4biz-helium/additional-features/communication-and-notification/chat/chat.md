Title: Chat
# Chat

The notion of "Chat" is used to allude to the exchange of written messages of instantaneous form. In this case, it allows the user to have contact to an attendant. In this section you will learn how to activate the chat, set the default agreement for call opening and adjust the default group, and other actions.

Chat can be used in three ways:

-   Manual: exchange of messages between several types of users (e.g.: requester and attendant) on a 4biz instance.

-   Automatic: used for messaging between user and a virtual assistant - via Chatbot, using Helper artificial intelligence.

-   Both: used to enable contact between the requester and the attendant, also allowing a user to interact with a chatbot.
