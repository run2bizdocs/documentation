# Register work order (WO) formula

This functionality is intended to create the client formulas to configure "how" will be the calculation of the total cost value of the contract service activity.

-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Integrated Management > Contract Management > WO Formula.

2.  In the tab "Formula Registration", it is necessary to complete the field necessary. When informing the formula options, remember that the purpose of each variable available to describe the formula:

    |   **Variable**  | **Description** |                                                                  **Purpose**                                                                  |
    |:---------------:|:---------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------:|
    |      vValor     |      Value      |                           Allows the user to enter a value that will be used to calculate the value of the activity                           |
    |    vDiasUteis   |   Working days  | Allows the input of the number of business days between the start date and the end date of the service order based on the contract schedule. |
    |  vDiasCorridos  |   Running days  |                                  Amount of days between the start date and the end date of the service order.                                |

    |  vComplexidade  |    Complexity   |       Based on the complexity chosen by the user, the system will return the corresponding value entered on the contract record screen.       |

3.  After describing the formula, click on "View Formula". This button represents the validation of the formula and where the calculation process is presented, transforming the formula text into a mathematical expression, and returning its calculated result, after clicking on "Simulate". Remember that it is possible to use the "{}" keys to delimit a text that you wish to include in the formula, where it will not influence the calculation of the value of the activity.

4.  Click on "Save". But, before save the formula, the system should validate the syntax and only allow the saving if is correct.
