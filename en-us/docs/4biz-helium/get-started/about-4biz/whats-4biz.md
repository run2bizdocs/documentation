4biz is a product that had its initial construction to meet the needs of ITSM (IT Service Management),
mainly for the fulfillment of the ITIL requirements, preached by the institution Pink Elephant, through
PinkVerify certification. Nowadays, 4biz meets 13 processes out of the 16 possible. The main

Base, SLA, Changes and CMDB.

This decision was based on the capacity of our Workflow to adapt to various business needs, and Builder,
by allowing the construction of new data inputs and integration possibilities.

create a digital workspace builder.

integration and machine learning with knowledge.

and allows to build new functionalities, applications and integrations. It is very close to RPA (Robotics process automation) products, but it brings different possibilities, such as the natural integration with the
