# What is 4biz ?

4biz, developed by 4biz CorporationÂ®, is a Service Management platform that connects people and digital resources to optimize work and amplify business results.

Through digital relationship portals, we optimize the user experience, and, through Intelligent **Digital Workflow and agile management**, we connect teams for greater customer-centric collaboration. We created this methodology using the Kanban framework, which gives greater visibility to task management, simplifies execution, and promotes team interaction and alignment.

What are the possibilities?
-------------------------------

There are cases of service management automated processes in several areas, such as:

*   Education.
*   Purchases.
*   Travel.
*   Human resources, such as staff, training, others.
*   Legal, such as elaboration and analysis of contracts, support, others.
*   Field service, such as equipment maintenance,  repairs and others.
*   Communication, Marketing, and others.

The 16 certified processes are:

4biz History
--------------------

4biz was initially created to meet the needs of ITSM (IT Service Management), always following the ITIL framework, and using the Pink Elephant Institution in Canada which is the standard for ITIL certification. 

Now a days, 4biz meets 16 processes out of the 16 possible processes. The main functionalities are Ticket Management (incidents and requests), Service Portfolio and Catalog, Knowledge Base, SLA, Changes, and CMDB.

Evolution
------------

One of the changes was the focus on business processes beyond IT, where the platform evolves to the Management of Business Services. This evolution was possible thanks to the ability of our workflow to adapt to different business needs.

Another important point is the Builder that allows the construction of new data entries and integration possibilities.

In 2018 we added another feature - Experience Center. This product is an initiative to create a digital workspace builder to meet the different needs of the many profiles of users, departments, and companies. 

Helper
-----

Helper is 4biz's Artificial Intelligence platform. It uses artificial intelligence to conduct increasingly improved dialogues with users on different platforms and, in addition to that, it can integrate with other systems, retrieving data through APIs, obtain better and more complete responses to questions from your users.

Builder
-----

Builder is the development framework of 4biz, which allows you to build new features, applications, and integrations. Create codeless dynamic forms and low code integrations or automate data workflows with powerful orchestrations. Extend your possibilities by taking advantage of Builder's natural integration with the Service Management Framework.
