# Configure parametrization - problem


Problem management manages the lifecycle of all problems from the first
identification, through to investigation, documentation and eventual removal.
The "Problem" parametrization must be made to allow the execution/use of this
process, it may be possible to define the default flow name for the problem, to
define whether the responsible party and the executing group will be notified
when the time to workaround the problem has expired , among other viable
actions.
